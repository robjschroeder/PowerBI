# JNUC 2021 - Dashboards with PowerBI
 
 This is the repo for the JNUC 2021 talk regarding building and customizing beautiful dashboards with PowerBI. It includes code examples and extra slides. When it is made available, a link to the session and transcript will be provided.

 The focus of the JNUC talk was focused around Macs, but many of the same principles can be applied for Mobile Devices like iOS and AppleTV devices.

# Extra Slides
These slides includes extra information that didn't make the cut for the JNUC 2021 time limit. 

This includes a big section on how to transform the Extension Attributes table which makes it so much easier to use Extension Attributes in visualizations and measures.

Depending on the feeback from JNUC 2021, some of this material may be folded into future presentation.
