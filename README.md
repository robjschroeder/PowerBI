# JNUC 2021 - Dashboards with PowerBI
 
 This is the repo for the JNUC 2021 talk regarding building and customizing beautiful dashboards with PowerBI. It includes code examples and extra slides. The JNUC session has been posted to YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfuVAqUmIEw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfuVAqUmIEw)

 Power BI Desktop app is free to use and is Windows only :(  If you want to publish or share your dashboard you may need additional licensing. See the links below for more details.

 The focus of the JNUC talk was focused around Macs, but many of the same principles can be applied for Mobile Devices like iOS and AppleTV devices.

# Extra Slides
These slides includes extra information that didn't make the cut for the JNUC 2021 time limit. 

This includes a large section on how to transform the Extension Attributes query. Using those steps make it much easier to use Extension Attributes in visualizations and measures.

Depending on the feeback from JNUC 2021, some of this material may be folded into future presentation.
